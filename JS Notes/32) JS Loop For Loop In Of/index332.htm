Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

Different Kinds of Loops:


JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for -               loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in -            loops through the properties of an object
for/of -            loops through the values of an iterable object
while -             loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while -          also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true








The For Loop:





The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

From the example above, you can read:

Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).

Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
