    The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)


When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.



The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects









With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:




JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page

JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page

JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes

JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes

JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

    What is the DOM?



The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.






The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:




"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."







The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

    What is the HTML DOM?


The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements


In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

    JavaScript - HTML DOM Methods


HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.

    The DOM Programming Interface


The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

    Example



The following example changes the content (the innerHTML) of the <p> element with id="demo":

Example
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
</script>

</body>
</html>



In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.

    The getElementById Method



The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.

In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.






The innerHTML Property


The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property.

The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.





The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>.
